Ernest is a lightweight test runner for Node.js.  The project has evolved out of my participation with <a href='http://github.com/mde/geddy">geddy js, a web framework, also written for Node.js.

Writing tests is simple an easy with Ernest!

Example:

Start by requiring the Ernest module.  Path may need to be altered depending on location of test files.
<pre>
var ernest = require('geddy/geddy-core/scripts/ernest');
</pre>

Create an namespace (object-literal) to wrap your tests.
<pre>
var myTests = {
  //preface each key with the word 'test'
  testThatSomethingWorks : function(){
    var foo = 'bar';
    //use Node's Assert module -- last parameter is fail message that is displayed. 
    //By default, it uses what's predefined in Ernest
    assert.ok(foo, this.fail); 
    assert.equal(foo, 'bar', this.fail);
  }
};
</pre>

And, for the last bit, pass your new test to Ernest:
<pre>
  ernest.execute(myTests);
</pre>

If you want tests to be run via 'make test' -- Save your tests in a directory called 'tests' in the module you're testing.

That's it!!! It's that easy!

Tests can be run one of two ways:

run all tests:  <code>make test</code>
individual tests: <code>node path/to/test.js</code>
