Writing tests is simple an easy with Ernest!

Example:

Start by requiring the Ernest module. Path may need to be altered depending on location of test files.



var ernest = require(‘geddy/geddy-core/scripts/ernest’);
var assert = require('assert);

Create an namespace (object-literal) to wrap your tests.



var myTests = {

  //preface each key with the word ‘test’

  testThatSomethingWorks : function(){

    var foo = ‘bar’;

    //use Node’s Assert module — last parameter is fail message that is displayed. 

    //By default, it uses what’s predefined in Ernest

    assert.ok(foo, this.fail); 

    assert.equal(foo, ‘bar’, this.fail);

  }

};

And, for the last bit, pass your new test to Ernest:



  ernest.execute(myTests);

If you want tests to be run via ‘make test’ — Save your tests in a directory called ‘tests’ in the module you’re testing.

That’s it!!! It’s that easy!

Tests can be run one of two ways:

run all tests: make test
individual tests: node path/to/test.js


Additionally I've included an example of tests that are actively being used in Geddy (http://www.github.com/mde/geddy).
